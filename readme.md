# ConnectN

This was inspired by a project I wrote for my first computer science class in university.
The assignment was to write the program in C, but I finished early and wanted to give myself
more of a challenge. Here's the result. This only works on x86 or x86-64 processors on Windows,
but the processor and the Windows version are not so important (it doesn't use very many extensions)

To build this, run `build` in the root directory. You must have `ml` (MASM, Microsoft's assembler) and
`link` (Microsoft's linker) available to the shell. I would recommend using the x86 Build Tools shell,
since it comes with installations of Visual Studio and sets both programs to be in path.
