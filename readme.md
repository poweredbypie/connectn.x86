# ConnectN

This was inspired by a project I wrote for my first computer science class in university.
The assignment was to write the program in C, but I finished early and wanted to give myself
more of a challenge. Here's the result. This only works on x86 or x86-64 processors on Windows,
but the processor and the Windows version are not so important (it doesn't use very many extensions)

To build this, you need to first create a `build/` directory, and then run `build.bat`. You must have
MASM (Microsoft's assembler) available in the shell's path. I would recommend just using the x86 Build Tools shell.
